  /**
   * This method verifies the functionality of exporting the order section data. It first waits for a brief timeout
   * to ensure that the page elements are fully loaded. Then, it navigates through the pharmacy section and selects
   * the order option once it's visible. After that, the method waits for the file download to begin by listening for
   * the 'download' event. Once the export button is clicked, it waits for the download to complete and saves the
   * file to the specified download directory. The file path of the downloaded file is stored in the `downloadPath`
   * variable for further use or validation. This method helps in validating that the export functionality works as
   * expected and the file is successfully downloaded.
